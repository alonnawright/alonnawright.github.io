## Mentoring

Working with students is one of my favorite parts of my job as a scientist. They often remind me how exciting science can be and nothing makes me happier than seeing them succeed, both during our time working together and beyond. 

Some of the topics I have mentored students on in the past include: 
  - Defining and troubleshooting bioinformatic pipelines.
  - Graduate school application process.
  - Finding rotation and dissertation laboratories.
  - Navigating the transition into graduate school.
  - The importance of maintaining your mental health.
  - Professional and academic networking.
  - Combatting imposter syndrome.
  - Personal values and skills inventory.
  - Career options in STEM.

If you're a student who feels like any of these may be useful to you, reach out! I'm always happy to chat.

#### NSURP
I have mentored [NSURP](https://nsurp.org/) students every summer since the program began in 2020. These students have gone on to present their research at multiple conferences and use the skills they learned during our time together to secure further academic opportunities and internships.

#### UC Davis
- I have completed a certificate course in Mentorship from UC Davis Graduate Pathways. 
- I often take on student mentees and offer academic and professional support, regardless of major or university status, on long-term or short term basis. 

#### Sheldon Biotechnology Academy
Since 2019, I have served as a mentor to cohorts of current junior and senior high school students at the Sheldon Biotechnology Academy through the conception, design, and execution of their capstone research project. This has entailed:
- introduction of biological topics for the students to design experiments around 
- providing materials to aid in their scientific comprehension
- experimental design and troubleshooting
- data analysis and interpretation
- poster design and scientific communication of results.

## Science Communication

I was raised in a low-income area as a first-generation student, so I have intentionally put a large effort into ensuring that science is accessible to all. A few of my favorite ways that I've been able to participate in SciCom efforts are: 
- Serving on the Scientific Advisory Board and Champion of the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative](https://microbiomedata.org/advisory/)
- [Skype a Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/)
- Talks to local high schools on my research facilitated through the [UC Davis DEB](https://deb.ucdavis.edu/).
- Conversations with the community about impacts of science (especially during the COVID era).
- Participating in conversations on Twitter with scientists and non-scientists on important and neat science topics.

## Volunteering

I really enjoy volunteering for STEM events in the Sacramento area that promote student engagement in STEM for underrepresented students. I've previously been involved with events at Sacramento State University, Sheldon Biotech High School, UC Davis, and other organizations with events ranging from family oriented STEM events in low-income areas, to events promoting STEM involvement for middle school girls.
