## Bacteriophage and Antimicrobial Resistance in Poultry Environments
#### *Dissertation work, Eisen Lab, UC Davis. 2019-present*

My work investigates microbial relationships through the lens of agricultural environments. AMR dissemination from agriculture is a public health and food safety issue and is exacerbated by antibiotic usage in agricultural production. Using previously generated datasets, I am interested in investigating the ecological and evolutionary relationships between bacteriophage and their bacterial hosts in the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). 

**The main questions I am interested in answering are:**
  1. **Where are the AMR genes originating from? Are bacteria or bacteriophage the main drivers of AMR retention and transmission?** 
  2. **Is there a correlation between the molecular mechanisms encoded by bacteriophage and AMR in the environment?**
  3. **What implications do these interactions have in the development of bacteriophage-based therapeutics?**


## Microbial Communities of Rehabilitated Soils in the Brazilian Cerrado
#### *Side project, UC Davis. 2018-2021*

This project used 16S rRNA gene analysis to understand how mining in the Brazilian Cerrado impacted bacterial communities in affected soils, and how rehabilitation through the application of rehabilitated biosolids impacted the microbial dynamics. The manuscript of this project is in preparation with anticipated submission of July 2021. 


## Superinfection Potential of Genetically Modified Nudivirus

My undergraduate capstone research project for my degree in Agricultural and Medical Biotechnology at the University of Kentucky was performed at [Lepidext](https://www.lepidext.com/) (a derivative of work at [ParaTechs Corporation](https://paratechs.com/)) in Lexington, Kentucky. This project aimed to develop a genetically modified nudivirus as a means of biological control of the *Helicoverpa zea* corn earworm pest, which is responsible for millions of dollars in agriculural damage each year. My independent project within the overall research was to determine the interactions between the wild-type nudivirus that exists ubiquitously in nature, and the genetically modified virus we developed. My work on this project led to the 2016 Global prize at the [Alltech Young Scientist competition](https://www.alltech.com/education/alltech-young-scientist), the largest international agri-science compeition.
