### Bacteriophage and Antimicrobial Resistance in Poultry Environments

My work investigates microbial relationships through the lens of agricultural environments. AMR dissemination from agriculture is a public health and food safety issue and is exacerbated by antibiotic usage in agricultural production. Using previously generated datasets, I am interested in investigating the ecological and evolutionary relationships between bacteriophage and their bacterial hosts in the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). 

**The main questions I am interested in answering are: **
  - **Where are the AMR genes originating from? Are bacteria or bacteriophage the main drivers of AMR retention and transmission?** 
  - **Is there a correlation between the molecular mechanisms encoded by bacteriophage and AMR in the environment?**
  - **What implications do these interactions have in the development of bacteriophage-based therapeutics? **
