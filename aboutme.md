I am a Ph.D. Candidate of Microbiology with a [Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology](https://biotech.ucdavis.edu/DEB_Program) in [Dr. Jonathan Eisen's lab](https://phylogenomics.me/) and a [Business Development Fellow](https://innovate.ucdavis.edu/business-development-fellowship-program) at UC Davis. My research interests are largely using publicly available datasets to understand microbial relationships across large scales using bioinformatics. Read more about my current research projects [here.](https://alonnawright.github.io/researchprojects/)

I am passionate about ensuring equity in STEM, in research through [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) especially in microbiome research through my role as the Early Career Representative on the Scientific Advisory Board of the [NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/) and in outreach through ensuring that science is accessible to all backgrounds. You can download my full CV [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Bqh6yQV-DefHjuX6xZQh5m-M5rMROfB/view?usp=sharing)

I live in Sacramento, California with my husband and our 2 cats and 2 dogs.  In my free time I enjoy gardening, reading memoirs, and volunteering with [Cake4Kids](https://www.cake4kids.org/) to bake birthday cakes for at-risk youth.
