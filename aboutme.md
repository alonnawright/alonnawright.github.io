subtitle: Ph.D. in Microbiology with a passion for engineering FAIR data solutions

I hold a Ph.D. in Microbiology with a [Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology](https://biotech.ucdavis.edu/DEB_Program) from [Dr. Jonathan Eisen's lab](https://phylogenomics.me/) and was a [Business Development Fellow](https://innovate.ucdavis.edu/business-development-fellowship-program) at UC Davis. My dissertation work largely focused on **using bioinformatics to investigate ecological relationships of microbes using previously generated datasets**, while my time as a Postdoctoral Scientist in Bioinformatics at [Novonesis](https://www.novonesis.com/en) has focused on **developing solutions that enable wet-lab scientists to quickly and accurately answer biological questions using omics data.** 

Take a look around to learn more about [my work](https://alonnawright.github.io/researchprojects/), [my outreach](https://alonnawright.github.io/outreach/), and [my skills](https://alonnawright.github.io/skills/). You can view my resume [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YDjtusRzyZuxGtNAaEWBpc9jZmv9XNX9/view?usp=drivesdk). I'd love to hear from you if you have a question or want to collaborate. Find the link to email me at the bottom of this page. 

I live in Sacramento, California with my mini dachshund, Nellie, and 2 cats, Clark and Barry.  In my free time I enjoy participating in community events, tending to my culinary garden, reading memoirs, making art, and volunteering with [Cake4Kids](https://www.cake4kids.org/) to bake birthday cakes for at-risk youth.
