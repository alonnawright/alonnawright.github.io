I am a Ph.D. Candidate of Microbiology with a [Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology](https://biotech.ucdavis.edu/DEB_Program) in [Dr. Jonathan Eisen's lab](https://phylogenomics.me/) at UC Davis. My research interests are largely using publicly available datasets to understang large scale microbial relationships using bioinformatics. 

I am passionate about ensuring equity in STEM, in research through [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) especially in microbiome research through the [NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/) and in outreach through ensuring that science is accessible to all backgrounds.

I live in Sacramento, California with my husband and our 2 cats and 2 dogs.  In my free time I enjoy gardening, reading memoirs, and volunteering with [Cake4Kids](https://www.cake4kids.org/) to bake birthday cakes for at-risk youth.
