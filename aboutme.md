I am a Ph.D. Candidate of Microbiology with a [Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology](https://biotech.ucdavis.edu/DEB_Program) in [Dr. Jonathan Eisen's lab](https://phylogenomics.me/) and a [Business Development Fellow](https://innovate.ucdavis.edu/business-development-fellowship-program) at UC Davis. My research interests are centered around **using bioinformatics to investigate ecological relationships of microbes using previously generated datasets**. Read more about my current research projects [here.](https://alonnawright.github.io/researchprojects/)

I am passionate about ensuring equity in STEM. I am an advocate for making data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) through my role as the Early Career Representative on the Scientific Advisory Board of the [NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/). I also frequently volunteer my time to outreach events and mentoring programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Read more about my outreach [here](https://alonnawright.github.io/outreach/).

I live in Sacramento, California with my husband and our 2 cats and 2 dogs.  In my free time I enjoy tending to my culinary garden, reading memoirs, and volunteering with [Cake4Kids](https://www.cake4kids.org/) to bake birthday cakes for at-risk youth.
