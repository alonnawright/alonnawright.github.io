I am a Ph.D. Candidate of Microbiology with a [Designated Emphasis in Biotechnology](https://biotech.ucdavis.edu/DEB_Program) in [Dr. Jonathan Eisen's lab](https://phylogenomics.me/) and a [Business Development Fellow](https://innovate.ucdavis.edu/business-development-fellowship-program) at UC Davis. My research interests are centered around **using bioinformatics to investigate ecological relationships of microbes using previously generated datasets**. 

Take a look around to learn more about [my work](https://alonnawright.github.io/researchprojects/), [my outreach](https://alonnawright.github.io/outreach/), and [my skills](https://alonnawright.github.io/skills/). You can view my resume [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRxvSILUPYBa-NpoTmP6aVLkwnITqU_R2mpFqusCO-U2YZMilG5sTxZYLXrYFs7VJ0EivaQpuZUOy7I/pub). I'd love to hear from you if you have a question or want to collaborate. Find the link to email me at the bottom of this page. 

I live in Sacramento, California with my husband and our 2 cats and 2 dogs.  In my free time I enjoy tending to my culinary garden, reading memoirs, and volunteering with [Cake4Kids](https://www.cake4kids.org/) to bake birthday cakes for at-risk youth.

I tweet [here](https://twitter.com/lonna_wright) often about science that I find cool and my life as a scientist (and beyond).
