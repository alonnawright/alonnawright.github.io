I'm a scientist interesting in making science accessible to all. Take a look around to learn more about my work, my outreach, and my skills. I'd love to hear from you if you have a question or want to collaborate. Find the link to email me at the bottom of this page. 

I tweet [here](www.twitter.com/lonna_wright) often about science I find cool and my life as a scientist (and beyond).
